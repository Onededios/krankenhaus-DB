## Context
A new virus has taken us by surprise worldwide, it's called 'jeta01'. It's a virus that mainly affects database designers, making them create unreliable nosql solutions that overflow over time.

You are one of the few IT professionals who still knows solutions based on the entity-relationship model. Your weapon: Postgresql and the knowledge you have acquired during the course, your destiny: to save humanity (Hans Zimmer's music playing in the background...)
